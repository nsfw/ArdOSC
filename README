chipKITOSC - A port of ArdOSC for chipKIT32
Based on:  ArdOSC 2.1  - OSC Library for Arduino.
Works with the chipKIT Network Shield

=== History ===
30JAN12 - working version 

=== Overview ===

This library most definately NEEDS HEAP allocated to it to run, by
default their is little or no heap allocated. You can allocate heap by
finding the "pic32.compiler.c.elf.flags" entry in the "platforms.txt"
and changing it to look like the following:

pic32.compiler.c.elf.flags=-Os::-Wl,--gc-sections,--defsym,_min_heap_size=8192::-mdebugger

Note: If you want to send and receive, you should initialize your
"client" with your "server" instance via something like:

OSCServer server;
OSCClient client;

void setup(){ 
     ...
     Ethernet.begin(myMac ,myIp); 
     server.begin(serverPort);	// for receiving
     client.begin(server);      // for sending
     ....
}

Also note: that the chipKit Ethernet libraries are implemented by the pic32, so they need to run occasionally, you can do this by either polling OSC or by calling Ethernet.PeriodicTasks() regularly. Keep in mind that when you are 'delaying()' you are NOT polling Ethernet.

=== Installation ===
Is the same as for Arduino Libraries, just copy the chipKITOSC folder into ..
